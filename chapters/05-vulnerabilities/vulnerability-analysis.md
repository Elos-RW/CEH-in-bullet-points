# Vulnerability analysis

- **Vulnerability research** helps identify vulnerabilities which could compromise the system
- Scanning types
  - **Active scanning**: interacting directly with the target network to discover vulnerabilities
  - **Passive scanning**: discovering vulnerabilities without a direct interaction with the target network

## Vulnerability categories

- Misconfiguration
- Default installations
- Buffer overflows
- Unpatched servers
- Design flaws
- Operating system flaws
- Application flaws
- Open services
- Default passwords

## Vulnerability assessment types

- **Active assessment**: through network scanners
- **Passive assessment**: by sniffing the traffic
- **External assessment**: vulnerabilities & threats that are accessible outside of the organization
- **Internal assessment**: vulnerabilities & threats that are present internally
- **Host-Based assessment**: vulnerabilities & threats on a specific server by examining the configuration
- **Network assessment**: identifies potential attacks on the network
- **Application assessment**: examines the configuration of the web infrastructure
- **Wireless network assessment**: vulnerabilities & threats in the organization's wireless network

## Vulnerability management

- Evaluation and control of the risks and vulnerabilities in the system
- Phases:
  - **Pre-assessment phase**
    - Creating baseline: Identifying critical assets and prioritizing them
  - **Assessment phase**
    - Vulnerability assessment: identifying known vulnerabilities
  - **Post-assessment phase**
    - **[Risk assessment](./../01-introduction/risk-management.md#risk-assessment)**: assessing the vulnerability and risk levels for the identified assets
    - **Remediation**: mitigating and reducing the severity of the identified vulnerabilities
    - **Verification**: ensuring that all phases have been successfully completed
    - **Monitoring**: identifying new threats and vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability assessment solution types

- Product-based solutions: installed in the internal network
- Service-based solutions: offered by third parties
- Tree-based assessment: different strategies are selected for each machine
- Inference-based assessment
  1. Find the protocols to scan
  2. Scan and find the found protocols and their services,
  3. Select the vulnerabilities and begins with executing relevant tests.

## Vulnerability scoring systems

- Vulnerabilities that are identified are stored into databases
- Certain scores based on their severity and risk

### CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System

- A free and open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities
- Helps to assess and prioritize vulnerability management processes.
- Assigns severity scores to vulnerabilities
- [Score calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) depends on metrics that include ease and impact of exploit.

### CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

- [Mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org)
- List of common identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities
- E.g. `CVE-2020-0023`: disclosure of user contacts over bluetooth due to a missing permission check on Android.

### NVD - National Vulnerability Database

- U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data
- [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- Includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics
  - E.g. [CVE](#cve---common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures)

## Vulnerability assessment report

- Written after an assessment is performed
- Classified into **security vulnerability report** and **security vulnerability summary**.
- Details of what has been done and what has been discovered during the assessment
- Created to help organizations resolve security issues if they exist
- Typically contain information about the scan, target, and results.
***Assessment Report steps***
*+ Executive Summary (scope and objects, testing narrative, finding summary, remediation).+*
*+ Asessment Overview (Scan information, Target information, Assessment Methodology).+*
*+ Finding (Scanned Host, Vulnerabilitise types, Details and notes).+*
*+ Risk Assessment (Vulnerabilites clasess, critical hosts).+*
*+ Recommendations (*Final step* remediation suggestions, lesson learned, awareness training).+*

## Vlnerability assessment tools

- Also known as **vulnerability scanner**s
- Scanning solutions perform vulnerability penetration tests in three steps
  1. locate the live hosts in the network
  2. enumerate open ports and services
  3. test the found services for known vulnerabilities by analyzing responses.
- Tool types
  - Host-based vulnerability assessment tools (for server with many application)(detect high level vulnerabilities and provide patches)
  - Depth assessment tools (uses signatures and fuzzing vulnerability tools to test unknow flaws in system)
  - Application-layer vulnerability assessment tools (for different kind of OSs, observing system vulns using external route/firewall"External vulnerability assessment")
  - Scope assessment tools (Applicaiton scope of work- testing vuln in applicaiton and OS, and provide a stander report)
  - Active/Passive tools (Active: perform vulns scan on the network and consume resources to work(Admins have control over timing and parameters) - Passive: not affecting system resources but only recive data and run it against set of rules)
  - Location/Data examined tools(network based scanner(live and server on machine), Agent based scanner, Proxy scanner, cluster scanner(like proxcy but run more than one task on different machines))
- **OpenVAS**
  - [Open-source](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas) software framework of several services and tools offering vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management.
### GFI LanGuard
### Qualys Freescan (agent based)
### Nexpose
### Nmap

- Nmap has scripting functionality, written in LUA
- You can scan multiple servers for multiple ports for multiple vulnerabilities.
- `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, **script scanning** and traceroute.
- Read more about Nmap in [Nmap | Scanning Tools](./../03-scanning-networks/scanning-tools.md#nmap)
- See [Detecting Shellshock using Nmap | Common vulnerabilities](./common-vulnerabilities.md#detecting-shellshock-using-nmap)

### Nessus

- [Website](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)
- 📝 Proprietary port and vulnerability scanner
- Scans include • misconfigurations • default passwords (has [Hydra](../06-system-hacking/password-cracking-tools.md#hydra) built-in) • DoS vulnerabilities
- Can be used to perform compliance auditing, like internal and external PCI DSS audit scans.

### Burp Suite

- 📝 Proxy tool to scan web vulnerabilities
- Allows manual testers to intercept all requests and responses between the browser and the target application
- Allows to view, edit or drop individual messages to manipulate the server-side or client-side components of the application.

### Nikto

- [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2) is an open source Nikto web server vulnerability scanner.
- Majorly looks for outdated software, dangerous files/CGI etc.
- E.g. `nikto -host cloudarchitecture.io`
- 🤗 Many of the modern scanners including Nessus, OpenVAS use Nikto to get information for their analysis.

### Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA)

- Identifies missing security updates and common security misconfigurations
- Assesses Windows and its sofware e.g.• Internet Explorer • IIS web server • Microsoft SQL Server, • Office macro settings
- It's [deprecated](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/mbsa-removal-and-guidance)

**>>> For Mobile **
### Vulners Scanner
- perform a passive vulnerability detection scan based os software (No compliance check)

### security Metrics Mobile
- A defese tool that comes with a PCI SSC compliance check
